# Unit Testers

These unit test applications can be built and run by using the commands:

+ `make fptest` && ./fptest
+ `make fetest` && ./fetest
+ `make endotest` && ./endotest
+ `make ecpttest` && ./ecpttest
+ `make ecmultest` && ./ecmultest

This tests each of the subsystems rigorously to verify that there are no corner cases where the math routines fail, which would be an exploitable flaw.
